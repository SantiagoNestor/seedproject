====================

Congratulations! 
----------
We want to see your awesomeness with a technical exercise!  We know that you may not have extensive … or any … experience with the technologies below, so the point of this exercise is to show your grasp of the concepts, resourcefulness and drive to learn.   We believe that you have the ability to assimilate the basics of modern technologies.  Now is your time to prove it.

What We Want
----------
A web application that displays some simple data and allows for a simple update or two.  There are very few specific requirements -

1.	Use the UML below as the definition for the data you’ll be displaying / updating.  You do not need to implement all of this but what you do has to match this diagram.

2.	The front end has to be **AngularJS**.  Again, don’t start to sweat if you’ve never even touched it – we’re looking for basic implementation - not high level experience.
3.	3.	You must create a data interface using **RESTful** services - created with Microsoft’s WebAPI v2 framework.
4.	Data must be accessed via **EntityFramework** 
5.	Code must be deposited on **GitHub**
6.	We need to be able to simply grab your solution from GitHub and run it.



You do not need to go overboard – you don’t have to add security or logging or 3-D visualizations.  These requirements are purposefully vague as we aren’t generally concerned with the what, rather the how.  This should be an approximately 4-8 hour exercise depending on your level of exposure to these technologies. 

When you are done, provide us the link to your GitHub repository.

Where to Start
----------
We don’t want you to worry about the insignificant details, so we’ve setup this seed project on GitHub for you to use as your foundation.


Bonus Points
----------
- Bootstrap
- EntityFramework Code First
- Sky’s the Limit…
- It runs
